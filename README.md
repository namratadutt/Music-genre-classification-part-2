# Music genre classification part-2: Classification

This repository contains two files:
1. FeaturesClassification.py : In this file, we do classification using different features separately. We have 2 models for Spectrogram, an ensemble of 3 models for MFCC, and Mel-spectrogram. 
2. Ensemble.py : In this file, we load the trained models from FeaturesClassification.py and classify music genres using an ensemble of all the models.
